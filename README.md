# MachineLearningRockPaperScissors
This is a rock paper scissors game made in Python where you make a rock, paper, or scissors symbol with your hand, and the program will use your computer to take a picture of you hand. Using machine learning, it will then determine which of the three symbols your hand made. Then it will randomly pick rock, paper or scissors, and we will see who the winner is!
